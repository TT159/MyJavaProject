# MyJavaProject
This is my first time to study and write Java code. I'd like to share this period. 

# Demos

In Demo03, I write a simple leap year cheker program to detect if a year is a leap year (special year with 366 days). It's a simple java code.</br>

In Demo07, I write a program where it constructs a wimdow and a random colorful bubble will move in this window. When the bubble reaches the bound of the window, it will change its moving direction and rebound off the bound.</br>

In Unit04 file, I start to learn about OOP, in which I learn what's a class, how to create a constructor and how to use the 'this' key word. I write some demos to help me understand this things. COOL. </br>
